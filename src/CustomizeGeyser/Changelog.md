# Changelog

## [1.0.6.0]

### Fixed
- added missing slush_salt_water to the default list
- fixed geysers being random even after RandomizerEnabled set to false; note that since the DLC a lot more geysers are predetermined, so randomizing only fully works on word generation!

## [1.0.5.0] EX1 S6-448916

### Fixed
- updated for SpacedOut

### Removed
- Highlander mode doesn't work anymore
