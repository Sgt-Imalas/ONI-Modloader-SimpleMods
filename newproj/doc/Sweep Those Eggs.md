Sweep Those Eggs

Remove eggs from stables.

This mods adds a building to the Food tab, which let's you set the maximum allowed number of critters in its room. Excess eggs get marked for sweeping, so your dupes put them away. Simply have a storage locker with 'sweep only' ready. Also works with automation.

Also increases limit of Critter Drop-Off to 100.

Note:
I would make a new artwork, but I am not an artist. If anyone wants to supply an actual bulletin board artwork, I would be happy to include it.
