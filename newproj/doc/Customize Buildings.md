* ConveyorReceptacleKG: 
* IUserControlledMax: set same as ConveyorReceptacleKG
* ReservoirNoGround: if true, reservoirs can be placed in the air
* ReservoirManualDelivery: if true, reservoirs will act like storage bins
*    - dupes will deliver selected liquids/gases until the capacity is at the slider amount
*    - liquid/gas pipes can still deliver any element and will ignore the slider limit
*    - activating, then deactivating an element checkbox drops it on the floor, for easy removal of rogue elements
* RailgunMaxLaunch: 
* ElectrolizerMaxPressure: pressure at which the elecrolizer will stop producing oxygen/hydrogen
* AirfilterDropsCanisters: if true, airfilters (as well as all other buildings) will drop gas canisters on deconstruction (instead of venting stored gases)
* NewRecipeRockCrusher: adds a new recipe to rock crusher -> Regolith To Sand
* AirConditionerAbsoluteOutput: if true, adds a slider to air conditioner/aqua tuner
*    - when set to 0 it will work as normal (-14 Â°C delta)
*    - otherwise will output material at exactly the desired temperature
*    - will preserve heat as normal, meaning high temperature delta will result in massive heating
*    - additional max DPU setting can be used to limit heating in exchange of lower throughput
*    - energy consumption scales with DPU
* SpaceHeaterTargetTemperature: add a slider to space heater/liquid heater which sets the shutoff temperature; does not prevent overheating

* BuildingBaseSettingGlobalFlag: if false, disable this feature altogether
* BuildingBaseSettings: can change a list of BuildingDef options of any building (even from other mods)
*    - this may be defined with either building ID or ingame name (case sensitive)
*    - null will keep the original setting
*    - all these settings are OPTIONAL and can be removed
*    - PowerConsumption: amount of power needed, some buildings will crash when set to 0 Watts, notably filters/shutoffs
*    - OverheatTemperature: temperature the building will stop working in Kelvin
*    - ExhaustKilowattsWhenActive: amount of heat released from the building (will heat building in vacuum instead)
*    - SelfHeatKilowattsWhenActive: amount of heat directly applied to the building;
*    - WARNING, if KilowattsWhenActive is a negative value and the temperature reaches below 0 Kelvin, the game will crash instantly

*    - ConstructionMass: array of float; must match count of elements; how much kg are needed to build it
*    - ThermalConductivity: thermal multiplier, probably only works on buildings already messing with temperatures; 0..1 will reduce the temperature transfer, while 1..100 will increase it; normal settings are 0.01 for insulated tiles and 2 for radiant pipes
* BuildingAdvancedMachineMultiplier: a list of building IDs; will multiply all storage and element converting properties of a building, which might break some stuff, so be mindfull
* BuildingAdvancedGlobalFlag: if false, disable this feature altogether
* BuildingAdvancedMaterial: more complex patches to buildings
*    - Id: building ID
*    - Index: material index that should be modified; applies to all if null
