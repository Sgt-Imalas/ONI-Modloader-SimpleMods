- to change any building from one to two ingredients set "MaterialCategory" and "ConstructionMass"
- MaterialCategory takes a string, one word for each material group
- ConstructionMass takes an array of mass, one float for each material group
- material groups are defined in "Steam\SteamApps\common\OxygenNotIncluded\OxygenNotIncluded_Data\StreamingAssets\elements\solid.yaml"
        both "tags" and "materialCategory" count towards this
- to change the material group, you may either edit the solid.yaml or use CustomizeElements mod
- since material groups are global, you may also use "BuildingAdvancedMaterial" to add elements to a specific building
- MaterialAppend preserves existing elements
- Index is required if you work with multi material recipes
